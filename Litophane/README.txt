Lithophane Lamp for 100 x 100 mm Lithophanes. by KaitlynH is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial - Share Alike license.

# Summary

This is a lithophane lamp I designed. Lithophanes should be 100 x 100 mm with a maximum of 3 mm of depth. The lithophanes slot in and can be moved / replaced by unscrewing the lid. All screw holes use m3 screws. I personally printed my lithophanes with a width between 0.8 and 3 mm.

Some assembly required.

## How to assemble:

Note: Print lithophanes and the "Lithodifuser" in white or translucent  material to let light through. I recommend printing lithophanes and the "lithodifuser" with 100% infill and everything else with 20% infill.

1. Print the "Lithoframe" and mount it on top of the "Lithobase" using m3 screws / glue. 

2. Mount the "Lithobase" on top of the "Litholegs" with m3 screws / glue. 

3. Print the light cylinder, and wrap LED strip lights around it unless you choose to choose to use a different lighting method.. There's a mounting hole on the bottom of the light cylinder to attach it to the center of the Lithobase using an m3 screw / nut. 

4. Wire everything up however you want. There's a slot for an on/off switch on one side of the "Lithobase". 

5. Finally, print the "Lithodifuser" and "Litholid" Glue the "Lithodifuser" to the under-side of the "Litholid." Place your lithophanes inside the slots of the "Lithoframe", and screw on the lid using four m3 screws. If you wish to replace "lithodifuser" with something like paper, you can.

Optional: Add LED strip lights to the under-side of the lamp to give out more light.
