# Summary

Are you tired of having to hold your phone?
Do you like it when your phone has a way to stand?
Do you want a really cool foldable and adjustable phone stand?!?!

Well look no further!

In only 3.5 hours you can be the envy of your friends with this state of the art (although not really) phone stand.

With added spaces for vinyl bumpers for anti-sliding action.
Although you could always use hot glue.
Or leave it as is, works fine either way.
